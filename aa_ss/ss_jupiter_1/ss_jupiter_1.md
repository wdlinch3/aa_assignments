# Jupiter I

	This worksheet is intended as a starting point for a set of notes intended to build our understanding of Jupiter. 

1. Look up the mass, radius, and rotational period of the Sun, Jupiter, and the Earth. Compare these physical characteristics to one another by taking ratios.  
     
2. Calculate the average density of Jupiter. To which solar system body (bodies) is this similar? 

The **oblateness** or **flattening** of a spherical celestial body is a measure of how far it deviates from being perfectly spherical. If b is defined as the center-to-pole radius and a is defined to be the center-to-equator radius, then ba would be close to 1 for a spherical object. The flattening is therefore defined to be 

	f \=1-ba	(oblateness)	  
(Note the similarity and difference with the definition of eccentricity of an ellipse.)

3. Look up these radii for Jupiter and calculate its oblateness. For comparison, the flattening of the Sun is 9 × 10⁻⁶. Compare Jupiter’s oblateness to that of other solar system planets (found in a table on [this page](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/solar-system-data)).

Jupiter’s oblateness has to do with two corrections to Newton’s Second Law that arise in rotating frames of reference (which are non-inertial):

	a=Fm-2v-(r)	(1)

	The first term is the usual one from Newton’s Second Law F=ma. The second term is called the Coriolis term. It is responsible for redirecting motion into unexpected directions. The third term is called the centrifugal term. It is responsible for the apparent outward-pushing effect when you are in a spinning frame of reference. We will discuss these effects more in class, but for now just know that  (lower-case omega) is the rotational rate and  points along the axis around which the rotation is happening. r is the position in space to the rotating particle, and v is its velocity vector. 

	The  operation between two vectors gives another vector that points in a direction perpendicular to the two vectors. For example, the term  v is the **cross product** of the vector  pointing along the axis of rotation and the vector v is the velocity vector of a particle. To find the direction of  v, you are supposed to use your right hand with your fingers pointing along  and curl them so that they point toward the direction of v. Then  v will be in the direction of your thumb. This is called the **right-hand rule**. 

4. Try to apply the right-hand rule to the third term (r) to show that the effect of it is to accelerate particles in a direction outward and parallel to the equator. (So not radially outward.) This is the centrifugal effect. 

 

5. Construct a quantitative model of the cross section of Jupiter similar to the one you made for the Sun in packet 4.0. Your model should include the basic structure of Jupiter’s interior in terms of sizes, densities, temperatures, and composition. Even if you do this correctly, you may come across conflicting reports and large uncertainties. Many of these have been resolved by the recent [Juno mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmHOj8VQvNE). (See also this video about [Juno cam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYymOxCuBaw) for fun and inspiration.)

6. Inspired by the Sun's story, try to construct a narrative that ties together Jupiter's composition (as a gas giant), the temperatures in its layers, convection, its differential rotation rates, and its oblateness. What does your model suggest about any potential magnetic field? Is there a dynamo at work?

	The second term in equation (1) can be used to understand Jupiter’s iconic atmospheric bands. From your comparisons to the interior of the Sun, you have probably concluded that there are strong convective currents responsible for heat transfer from the 25,000 K core to 300 K atmosphere. Similarly to the Sun there are regions in which the hotter material rises and others in which they are sinking. 

7. Try to use the right-hand rule applied to the second term in equation (1) to argue that currents rising to the surface (the **zones**) will experience a deflection counter to the surface rotation and sinking currents (the **bands**) will deflect into the direction of the rotation. Use this to explain the band structure of the surface currents. This is called the **zonal flow**. Compare your understanding to figures 11.5 and 11.6 in the textbook.

	It is difficult to understand the interior of Jupiter without talking in more detail about the phases of matter. In particular the phases of hydrogen. In class we will discuss [phase diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram) in general and that of [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen#Phases) (shown at right) in particular. The general idea is that if we lower the temperature, then vapors condense to liquids and liquids freeze into solids. Similarly, if we increase the pressure, a vapor can be made to condense to a liquid or a liquid can be forced to solidify. In general then, the state of matter depends on the pressure and temperature. Note that in the plot above, it is the logarithm (base 10\) of the temperature and pressure that are plotted. For example the point where the Gas/Liquid line ends has coordinates approximately (log(P),log(T)) \= (6, 2). This means that at that point in the diagram the pressure is P=106 Pa \=1 MPa and the temperature is T= 102 \=100 K. Recall also from chemistry that  the **pressure** 

	P= ForceArea  	(pressure)

is the force exerted per unit area. The standard units for pressure are **Pascals** with 1 Pa \= 1 N/m2. 

8. Go back to your cross section and include the pressure ranges in megapascals (MPa) for the different layers. What is the pressure of our own atmosphere in these units? Show that this corresponds to a weight of 10 Newton for every square centimeter. Estimate the weight of the atmosphere on your body. Why are you not crushed under this enormous weight?

9. Together with the temperatures, check which phase of matter hydrogen is in for your various regions using the **phase diagram** for hydrogen given above . Do they match the reported phases?

## Jupiter’s satellites

Recall from your Kepler practice that Jupiter has four large moons (a.k.a. the **Galilean moons**) called **Io**, **Europa**, **Ganymede**, and **Callisto**. In standard natural satellite terminology, these are also known as Jupiter I – IV. (Yes, the Moon is a.k.a Earth I.)

10. Dig up your Kepler assignment and use it to fill in the first two rows of the chart

|  | Io | Europa | Ganymede | Callisto |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Orbital radius (\_\_) |  |  |  |  |
| Orbital period (days) |  |  |  |  |
| Rotational period (days) | 1.77 | 3.55 | 7.15 | 16.7 |
| Mass (kg) |  |  |  |  |
| Diameter (km) |  |  |  |  |
| Density (g/cm3) |  |  |  |  |

11. What do you notice about the orbital and rotational periods? Explain what this says about the moons as they orbit. Explain how this relates to the motion of our own Moon.

12. Calculate the *ratios* of the orbital periods of the moons. What do you notice? 

The phenomenon that the moons’ orbital periods are multiples of one another is called **orbital resonance** (see [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance)). The basic idea behind this is that if energy is pumped into a system periodically, that system tends to also become periodic with a period that is related to the period of the driving force. 

The phenomenon that the Moon rotates on its axis with the same period as its rotation around the Earth (and in the same sense) is called **tidal locking** (see [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking)).

13. The diagram below is a sketch representing the gravitational acceleration on the surface of a spherical body caused by a very massive object (the dot on the right) in close proximity. It is an exaggeration of the gravitational field on the surface of a secondary (*e.g.* a moon) co-orbiting a primary (*e.g.* a planet). In the accompanying diagram draw the analogous representation of the gravitational field as it appears to someone on the secondary. To do this, take the vector in the middle labeled *C*, and subtract it from all the other vectors. You should get a field that looks symmetrical across the vertical axis through the center of the body. 

This is called the **tidal field**. It shows that a secondary body is stretched in the direction of the primary and squeezed in the perpendicular direction. If a body is rotating on its axis, this tidal field will drag on the body, causing its rotation to slow down. This is called **tidal friction**. Eventually, its rotational period will match its orbital period, resulting in tidal locking. 

14. If the orbit of the secondary is elliptical, then Kepler’s Second Laws implies that the near side must **librate**: It cannot stay perfectly aligned and seems to wobble. Here’s a gif of the [libration of the Moon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Lunation_animation_April_2007.gif); what do you see happening? Explain this libration from the constant rotational speed of the Moon on its axis and the implications of Kepler’s second law concerning the speed of the Moon on its elliptical orbit.

15.  Previously, we have discussed that angular momentum must be conserved and that this causes rotational spin-up when mass contracts toward a center. If tidal friction spins an object down instead of up, what do you expect should happen to the orbit of that object?

Io is tidally locked to Jupiter but it is in orbital resonance with Europa. This resonance causes periodic tugs on Io that keep its orbit shaped as an ellipse. Because of this, Io is constantly undergoing libration that deforms its shape. This perpetual deformation heats Io just like how repeatedly bending metal heats up the metal, so Io presumably has a sea of molten lava under its crust. Indeed, although Io should be a long-dead space rock, it is instead the most geologically active object in the solar system. Its hottest volcanoes spew heavy ions (mostly sulfur) into the magnetosphere you speculated that Jupiter should have in problem 6\. 

16. Let’s assume Jupiter’s magnetosphere rotates at the same rate as Jupiter. (In fact, we get an accurate measurement of Jupiter’s rotation rate precisely by looking at this magnetosphere.) Together with the Alvén theorem (a.k.a. frozen-in theorem), argue that the heavy ions from Io are dragged around and smeared out into a toroidal tube with a radius equal to that of Io’s orbit. This is called Io’s **plasma torus** (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_torus)). What is the relative speed of the plasma wind that you would experience if you were standing on the surface of Io? What do you think the radiation levels are like on Io?

17. Go back to the table above and look up the masses and diameters of the Galilean moons. Use these numbers to calculate the densities in gcm3 and fill in the last row. What do you notice? Thinking back to the nebular hypothesis, formulate a hypothesis explaining this observation.

Besides the 4 Galilean Moons, there are four smaller satellites within Io’s orbit called the **Amalthea group** consisting of **Metis**, **Adrastea**, **Amalthea**, and **Thebe**. All are tidally locked with Jupiter.

18. Make another table of the orbital radii of the Amalthea group. Write the radii in multiples of Jupiter’s radius, and check that their periods obey Kepler’s third law.

19. Calculate the radius of a Jovio-stationary orbit. (Hint: Use the formula for the orbital radius in our [equation sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1mI-sdzAxJFSf8ZZbeYfI_a9FznPwg2NDIp6_5cJR4/edit?usp=share_link).) Analogously to geostationary orbits, this is an orbit in the equatorial plane with a period that is equal to the rotational period of Jupiter. Compare the radius of this orbit to those of the Amalthean moons. What do your findings indicate about Metis and Adrastea?
