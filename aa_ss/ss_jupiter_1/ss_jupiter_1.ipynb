    "## Rotating frames of reference\n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least) two approaches to describing Jupiter's oblateness. \n",
    "Intuitively, it's puffed up because it rotates so quickly and it's made up of a non-rigid material. Let us describe it in this approach by going to a frame of reference in which we spin with Jupiter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in our unit on astrodynamics, an emphasis was placed on Newton's first law. This law established that there are frames of reference that absolutely at rest: They do not move over and they do not spin. Inertial frames of reference were ones that are moving at a constant velocity with respect to this at-rest frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "This was important because Newton's second law was the statement that *in and **inertial** frame of reference*, the net force on a particle $\\vec F_{net}$ is related to that particle's acceleration $\\vec a$ by $\\vec F_{net} = m\\vec a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose instead, that we go to a frame of reference that is rotating around the origin of an inertial frame. To specify such a rotation, we need an axis around which it is rotating and the angular speed with which it does so. In other words, we need to specify a vector $\\vec \\omega$, say, the size $\\omega$ of which gives the rotational speed in radians per second. This vector will lie along the axis of rotation with the direction assigned by the right-hand-rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an inertial frame of reference, and therefore, we have no right to expect that $\\vec F_{net} = m\\vec a$ in this frame. In fact, we can start with $\\vec F_{net} = m\\vec a$ in the inertial frame and then transform to coordinates that rotate as implied by the anguar velocity vector $\\vec \\omega$. If you do this carefully using multi-variable calculus, you will find two corrections to Newton's second law. To express them clearly, we first rewrite Newton II as $\\vec a= \\frac { {\\vec F}_{net} } m$, and then switch to the rotating frame to find:\n",
    "<a id=\"rot\">\n",
    "$${\\vec a}=\\frac{\\vec F_{net}}m -2{\\vec \\omega} \\times {\\vec v}-{\\vec \\omega} \\times ({\\vec \\omega} \\times {\\vec r})\t\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term is the usual one from Newton’s Second Law. The second term is called the **Coriolis term**. It is responsible for redirecting motion into unexpected directions. The third term is called the **centrifugal term**. It is responsible for the apparent outward-pushing effect when you are in a spinning frame of reference. We will discuss these effects more in class, but for now just know that ${\\omega}$ (lower-case omega) is the rotational rate (in radians/second) and ${\\vec \\omega}$ points along the axis around which the rotation is happening. ${\\vec r}$ is the position in space of the rotating particle, and $\\vec v$ is its velocity vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "The  operation $\\times$ between two vectors gives another vector that points in a direction perpendicular to the two vectors and assigned by the right-hand-rule; it is called the **cross product**:\n",
    "For example, the term ${\\vec \\omega}\\times\\vec v$ is the cross produce of the vector $\\vec \\omega$ pointing along the axis of rotation and the vector $\\vec v$ is the velocity vector of a particle. To find the direction of ${\\vec \\omega}\\times\\vec v$, you are supposed to use your right hand with your fingers pointing along ${\\vec \\omega}$ and curl them so that they point toward the direction of $\\vec v$. Then ${\\vec \\omega}\\times\\vec v$ will be in the direction of your thumb. This is called the **right-hand rule**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> 4. Try to apply the right-hand rule to the third term $-\\vec \\omega \\times (\\vec \\omega\\times \\vec r)$ to show that the effect of it is to accelerate particles in a direction outward and parallel to the equator. (So not radially outward.) This is the **centrifugal effect**. Hint: the placement of the parenthesis is important; you must the direction of find $\\vec \\omega\\times \\vec r$ first, then repeat the construction to find the direction of $\\vec \\omega\\times (\\cdots)$, and finally, reverse the result because of the $-$ sign.

    "Io is tidally locked to Jupiter but it is in orbital resonance with Europa. This resonance causes periodic tugs on Io that keep its orbit shaped as an ellipse. Because of this, Io is constantly undergoing libration that deforms its shape. This perpetual deformation heats Io just like how repeatedly bending metal heats up the metal, so Io presumably has a sea of molten lava under its crust. Indeed, although Io should be a long-dead space rock, it is instead the most geologically active object in the solar system. Its hottest volcanoes spew heavy ions (mostly sulfur) into the magnetosphere you speculated that Jupiter should have in problem 6\\. \n",

Together with the Alvén theorem (a.k.a. frozen-in theorem), argue that the heavy ions from Io are dragged around and smeared out into a toroidal tube with a radius equal to that of Io’s orbit. This is called Io’s **plasma torus** (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_torus)).
