# Solar System I: Structure

The solar system consists of the titular star, the 8 planets **Mercury**, **Venus**, **Earth**, **Mars**, **Jupiter**, **Saturn**, **Uranus**, and **Neptune**. In between Mars and Jupiter we find the **asteroid belt**, and beyond Neptune there is the **Kuiper belt**. 

1. The mean distance between the **Sun** and the Earth is 1 AU by definition. This is about 150 million kilometers. How many seconds does it take for the light emitted by the sun to reach us? 

Table 6.1 on page 138 of the textbook has a table with information about the objects in the solar system. Part of it is reproduced here:

|  | Mercury | Venus | Earth | Mars | Jupiter | Saturn | Uranus | Neptune |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| M (M) | 0.055 | 0.82 | 1 | 0.11 | 318 | 95 | 15 | 17 |
| R (R) | 0.38 | 0.95 | 1 | 0.53 | 11.2 | 9.5 | 4.0 | 3.9 |
|   gcm3 | 5.4 | 5.2 | 5.5 | 3.9 | 1.3 | 0.7 | 1.3 | 1.6 |
| a (AU) | 0.39 | 0.72 | 1 | 1.52 | 5.2 | 9.5 | 19.2 | 30.1 |

Table 1: Physical data of the planets relative to the Earth’s mass M=6.01024 kg, radius R=6400 km, and orbital radius 1 AU \= 1.5 108 km. 

2. Make a scale model showing the distances of the planets from the Sun.

3. Make a scale model of the sizes of the planets. 

4. Is it feasible to make a model that accurately represents the scales of the sizes and the distances simultaneously? If so, please make one. If not, why not?

5. The 8 planets split into two groups using the physical features described in the table. Describe your splitting by referring explicitly to the concepts of size, mass, density (), and proximity to the Sun. The members of these two groups are referred to as **terrestrial** or **Jovian**. Explain why you think that is. 

The terrestrial planets have some further similarities and differences. For example,  they all have **atmospheres** although they are either much thinner than Earth’s (Mercury and Mars) or thicker and hotter (Venus). Only the Earth has oxygen and liquid water on its surface. Earth and Mars have moons, but Mercury and Venus do not. Earth and Mercury have (weak) **magnetospheres**, but Venus and Mars do not. Earth and Mars spin at (almost) the same rate, but Mercury and Venus spin much more slowly, and Venus even spins in the opposite direction (**retrograde**). 

6. Add up the masses of all the terrestrial planets except Earth and compare the result to the mass of the Earth. 

7. Add up the masses of all the planets except Jupiter and compare it to the mass of Jupiter. 

8. By what factor is the mass of the Sun larger than the sum of the masses of all the planets? What percentage of the mass of the solar system is accounted for by the Sun alone?

As you just learned, 99.9% of the mass of the solar system resides in the Sun. The 8 planets orbiting the Sun are evenly split between the terrestrial planets (a.k.a. the **rocky planets**) and the Jovian planets (a.k.a. the **gas giants**). The rocky planets all orbit within 1.5 AU. The gas giants inhabit the space between roughly 5 AU and 30 AU. 

Between Mars and Jupiter there is a region called the **asteroid belt** or the **main (asteroid) belt**, consisting of small rocky, metallic, or icy bodies called **asteroids**. It is an example of a **circumstellar disk**, because it is shaped like an annulus around the Sun. (Circumstellar means “star-surrounding”.) This disk consists of hundreds of thousands of small asteroids separated on average by a distance of one million kilometers. (This means that contrary to sci-fi representations, a spaceship blasting through the belt has almost no chance of reaching an asteroid by accident.) By far the largest object in the asteroid belt is the dwarf planet **Ceres**, with a diameter of 950 km. The only other “large” asteroids in the belt are Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea with diameters around 500 km. 

Beyond Neptune, there is another circumstellar disk called the **Kuiper belt**. It extends from around 30 AU out to a distance of around 50 AU. Whereas most members of the asteroid belt are rocky and/or metallic, most bodies in the Kuiper belt are made of frozen methane, ammonia, and water. Additionally, the dwarf planets **Pluto**, Orcus, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake. 

The Kuiper belt objects are a subset of the **trans-Neptunian object**s (TNOs). Outside of the Kuiper belt we encounter the scattered disk objects, extreme trans-Neptunian objects, and finally the **Oort cloud object**s. The Oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical shell of icy planetesimals surrounding the Sun between radii of 2,000 to 200,000 AU that was proposed to explain the existence of comets with extremely elliptical and highly inclined orbits (*e.g.* Halley, Hale-Bop, and the recent visitor [Tsuchinshan-ATLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\))). Such comets are eventually destroyed by their repeated encounters with the Sun, so there must be a large supply of them for us to continue to see them in our mature solar system. 

9. Briefly research the asteroid belt and write a paragraph about your favorite main belt asteroid.

10. Briefly research trans-Neptunian objects and write a paragraph about your favorite TNO.
