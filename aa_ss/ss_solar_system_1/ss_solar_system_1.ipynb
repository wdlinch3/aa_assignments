The Oort cloud is a hypothetical spherical shell of icy planetesimals surrounding the Sun between radii of 2,000 to 200,000 AU that was proposed to explain the existence of comets with extremely elliptical and highly inclined orbits (*e.g.* Halley, Hale-Bop, and the recent visitor [Tsuchinshan-ATLAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2023_A3_\\(Tsuchinshan%E2%80%93ATLAS\\))). Such comets are eventually destroyed by their repeated encounters with the Sun, so there must be a large supply of them for us to continue to see them in our mature solar system. \n",

    "There are many problems with this very crude analysis, but the most egregious is probably the approximation that all the asteroids are 6 m in diameter. In fact, the distribution of asteroid sizes is not simple. From the reference provided, you can extract a distribution function for the number of asteroids of size at least $D$ (in km) of the form $N=10^{10-\\frac12 D}$. This distribution is not even power-law, so we suspect a naïve use of an average radius of 6 meters for an asteroid is not a very good approximation. In fact, the esimated number of asteroids in the belt is in the millions, not the $10^{18}$ that we found. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete objection, let us note that the largest known asteroid in the main belt is Ceres, which we already know a previous packet has a mass of $M_{ceres}\\approx 9.4\\times 10^{20}$. Therefore, it alone accounts for $52\\%$ of the mass of the belt. Dropping this single asteroid from the pool therefore increases the average separation by almost $20\\%$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, this analysis goes a long way to giving us some intuition for why asteroid belts are not dangerous: Taking a moon's worth of mass and spreading it out over a torus of radius 2-3 AU makes it *really* sparsely-populated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reported average separation of asteroids in the belt is [one million kilometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt). This exercise carries many lessons. Firstly, we cannot trust such crude estimate. However, given that we are off by a factor of 1000, you should wonder what we missed. Looking back at the formula for the separation estimate, we see that it only depends sensitively on the radius $R$ of the asteroids, because all other variables appear under a cube root. (If you don't know what I mean by this, ask!) Another lesson is that without knowing much detail at all, we can not only get a sense of the sizes of the astrophysical variables involved, but we can understand what the astrophysical reasons are for why the answer is what it is. Finally, we learn how big space is: dipping into an asteroid field is not going to save the Millenium Falcon from Tie fighters. \n"
