    "In `aa:universe`, we will talk about electromagnetic radiation and its interaction with matter. Visible light is an example of electromagnetic radiation, but so are microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays. We are delaying the treatment of electromagnetic radiation, because most of the applications come from studying stars other than the single one in our solar system, and this class has already been physics-heavy. For our current purposes, all we need to know is that any physical object radiates electromagnetic waves in a particular way that is determined by its temperature. The amount of radiation of each type (wavelength) is determined entirely by the object’s temperature through something called the Planck radiation curve. Conversely, we can determine the temperature of an object by fitting its radiation curve to the Planck law. In this way, the **effective temperature** of the Sun is determined to be $T=5800$ `K`.\n",

    "What you have just derived in problem 7 is called the **Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale**. It is the time it would take for the Sun to collapse completely by gravitational attraction alone if it were to do so by radiating energy at a constant rate equal to the current rate. More realistically, the rate would not be constant, and we would not be able to use up all of the gravitational energy stored in the current configuration of the Sun. These effects would act to reduce the time scale, but even under the simplifying assumptions, we are still a factor of 10 or more short of the 4.6 billion year age of the Sun. From this, we conclude that gravitational energy alone is several orders of magnitude too small to explain the luminosity of the Sun. \n",

    "[^1]:  The physical intuition behind this is the following: Contrary to what you learned in chemistry (and Newtonian physics), mass is not required to be conserved in physical processes. Instead, mass is a form of energy with another form being, for example, kinetic energy (the energy of motion). Together they are conserved, but mass can be converted to energy and *vice versa*. You can think of Einstein's famous formula as the energy you would get out of a particle if you converted its mass entirely to energy."
