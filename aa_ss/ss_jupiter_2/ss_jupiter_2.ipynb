This is because things like comets and (dwarf) planets are not giant solid rocks or blocks of ice. The Earth, for example, is a ball of liquid with a thin solid crust floating on top.

Nevertheless, objects that end up near these points tend to stay close to these points, so you should not be surprised to find out that there are large groups of asteroids near the $L_4$ and $L_5$ Sun-Jupiter Lagrange points. The first such asteroid discovered was named [588 Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/588_Achilles) near $L_4$. Because of this, the collection became known as the [Trojan asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_trojan).

    "You can see from the Maxwell distribution that there are molecules in the gas with speeds much higher than the average velocity. In fact, there is always a small but non-zero fraction of the molecules that have speeds higher than the escape speed for that astronomical body. When these molecules escape into space, the continual random collisions of the remaining gas replenishes this high-speed “tail” of the distribution by giving some molecules that had lower speeds higher speed. This process will continue as long as the temperature of the gas is not lowered, so any atmosphere will gradually leak into space. How long it takes for a substantial part of the atmosphere to escape in this way depends only on the ratio between the average molecular speed (so temperature and molar mass) and escape speed (so mass of and radius of astronomical body). For an atmosphere to stick around for billions of years, the rule of thumb is that $v_{ave}$ should be at least a factor of 6 smaller than $v_{esc}$. \n",

Use this to show that molecular hydrogen may be expected to leak out of our atmosphere over time, whereas nitrogen or oxygen will not. Check that it makes sense that Jupiter would have a thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium."
