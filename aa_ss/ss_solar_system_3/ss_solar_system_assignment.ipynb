    "In this packet, we finish our discussion of the **solar nebular disk model**. Recall that we studied the fate of a giant molecular cloud collapsing and fragmenting under its own gravity: When the mass of the cloud of temperature $T$ and mass density $\\rho$ exceeds the Jeans mass \n",

    "the temperature of the cloud, and therefore, the average kinetic energy of the molecules is insufficient to prevent the collapse. The collapse depends only on the density of the cloud and the contraction is the same in all parts of the cloud, leading to fragmentation. Each fragment collapses to its own **proto-stellar nebula** and one of them becomes our **proto-solar nebula**. We note that this picture suggests stars are born in groups, and this is indeed true. Because of this, the nebulae in which star birth is happening are often called **stellar nurseries**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We now focus on our proto-solar nebula. For simplicity, let us pretend that our nebula is roughly spherical. All the particles making up this nebula have random velocities of various speeds and in various directions. In a `x_astrodynamics_2`, we learned that the average of these gives the velocity of the center of mass of the nebula. For simplicity, again, we will go to an inertial frame of reference in which we are traveling along with the cloud. When we do this, the center of mass is at rest from our point of view. Now, all the particles will be orbiting this center of mass on randomly-oriented orbits, and we can average over orbits. Although the orbits are randomly distributed, statistically, we will always have slightly more orbits in one plane than another, so when we average we will find that there is a plane through the center of mass that has more orbits roughly parallel with it than any other plane. Furthermore, with respect to this plane, slightly more or fewer orbits will be directed clockwise *versus* counter-clockwise. The result is that even though individual particle motions look random, overall the nebula has an average direction of rotation. \n",

    "Just as it is difficult to change the “quantity of motion” (linear momentum) of an object with a large “quantity of matter” (mass), so too is it difficult to change its “quantity of *rotational* motion”. I have no idea whether Newton called this property “quantity of rotational motion”, but the modern term is **angular momentum**. Angular momentum is most often denoted by the letter $L$. Just as you need a force to change a linear momentum (Newton II), so too a “twisting force” is needed to change angular momentum. The “twisting force” is called **torque** denoted by the Greek letter $\\tau$ (tau). We will not need to know what torques are exactly, but we can reason by analogy. Just as forces change linear momenta, so torques change angular momenta:\n",

    "Returning now to our slightly-rotating cloud of molecules, we are saying that this large cloud has some angular momentum $L_i$ where the $i$ stands for “initial”. When there are no external forces acting on a system, then the linear momentum of the system is a constant in time. Similarly, since there are no external twisting forces acting on our cloud, the angular momentum of the cloud is also constant in time. Remember, though, that the cloud is contracting. If we wait until the cloud is smaller, it will have an angular momentum $L_f$ where $f$ stands for “final”. Constant angular momentum means that the big cloud’s angular momentum is the same as that of the small cloud. In symbols: \n",

The angular momentum with your arms out is $L_i$ whereas the angular momentum with your arms in is $L_f$. When you had your arms out, it was more difficult to spin you up than when you had your arms down: Your **rotational inertia** went from high to low. This concept or rotational inertial is the rotational analog of mass: It's difficult to change the velocity of a large mass. Similarly, the rotational analog of velocity is called **angular velocity**: Just as the velocity is the rate of change of position, so the angular velocity $\\omega$ (omega) is the rate of change of angle $\\theta$ (theta): \n",

    "Coming back to our collapsing cloud, the large cloud has some initial angular momentum $L_i$ but since the cloud is so large, it is barely noticeable that it has any rotation. Nevertheless it *is* rotating in a plane through the center of mass defined by this angular momentum as described in reference to the average particle orbits above. The particles in the cloud are attracted to the center of mass, so they fall toward it, but in doing so, they must maintain the overall angular momentum (since it is constant). The only way this can happen is if they start to orbit faster. Because they are spinning, they feel like they are being flung outward the same way a salad spinner removes water from lettuce, and it is difficult for them to reach the center. Because of this, the giant cloud deforms into a disk-like distribution of particles that is spinning at a noticeable rate. As the cloud continues to contract, it continues to **spin up** and flatten out, so that in the final stages of the collapse we are left with a giant spinning pancake of gas and dust. This is the **proto-solar disk**. \n",

    "- Firstly, they absorb and reradiate light, thereby thermally cooling the cloud, lowering its temperature to below the critical temperature for gravitational collapse.\n",
    "- Secondly, they act as seeds for **condensation**, in a process very similar to how raindrops form.[^1] When the temperature of a cloud drops, the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules drops. When their speeds are low enough, an encounter with a dust molecule may cause them to bind with it by the van der Waals (electrostatic) force. Thus, dust grains are **condensation nuclei**. Once such clumps form, they encounter more material randomly and bind to it electrostatically making them bigger. Before eventually, their mass causes a slight gravitational attraction leading to more than just random encounters, and they grow larger. More mass means more attraction, so more mass, *et cetera*. This is the process of **accretion**. \n",

    "To recapitulate: We started with a **giant molecular cloud** (**GMC**) that collapses under its own weight because **interstellar dust** effectively radiates thermal energy from the cloud and lowers its temperature to a point that the gravitational potential destabilizes it. As the cloud begins to collapse, it does so by **spinning up** to preserve **angular momentum**. The outer parts of the cloud collapse to a disk and suffer only a modest amount of heating because they are diffuse. Meanwhile the core of the cloud becomes very dense, trapping heat and increasing in temperature by hundreds of thousands of degrees as it becomes a **protostar**. \n",

    "While this is happening, the rest of the cloud is undergoing the processes of **condensation** and **accretion** to form **planetesimals** from the ISM. These are all traveling in similar orbits allowing them to **coalesce** further into **protoplanets**. \n",

    "Recall that in order for a molecular cloud to be able to contract, it had to be able to radiate away heat to lower the temperature so that the kinetic energy falls below the gravitational potential energy at the onset of the Jeans instability. This is possible because the density of the cloud is low, so the light carrying away the heat can escape. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the cloud contracts, the gravitational potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy of the particles in the cloud which is radiated away by the escaping light. The result is that as the cloud contracts, the temperature of the cloud stays the same. This is called **isothermal contraction**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, however, the density in the core of the cloud grows to a point that that light cannot easily escape. Now the gravitational energy is converted into kinetic energy that cannot be radiated away, but instead, heats the particles in the cloud. The molecular cloud retains this increased kinetic energy that is being converted from the gravitational energy of the contraction, so the temperature of this part of the cloud increases. At this stage the heat in this part of the cloud is nearly constant, and the name for this is **adiabatic contraction**. \n",

The [volatiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_\\(astrogeology\\)) can only form much farther out. This distribution of condensing materials gives rise to **planetary differentiation**: the phenomenon that the fraction of refractory materials in the plantes decreases as we move farther out from the Sun, and that–conversely–the fraction of volatiles increases.

For example, the [Europa Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper), a mission to Jupiter’s fourth-largest moon, will spend the two years flying to Mars, slingshotting around, catching back up to Earth and slingshotting around Earth to finally be on its way to Jupiter (which it will reach a little over three years later). \n",

This is because it is energetically favorable for water at this temperature and pressure to be in the liquid phase instead of to remain in the gas phase. However, the vapor phase is very homogeneous, so there are no special points at which condensation can begin. If any point in space is just as good as any other point, how to choose equitably? Dust grains in the atmosphere break the stalemate, as water molecules find any impurity (such as dust) to use as a nucleation site.
