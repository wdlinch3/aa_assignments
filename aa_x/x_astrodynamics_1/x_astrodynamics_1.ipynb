    "We will now explain in more detail where this result comes from. Consider the diagram below describing uniform circular motion. When the particle is at the point labeled $A$, it has velocity ${\\bf v}_1$ and when it is at the point labeled $B$ it has velocity ${\\bf v}_2$. Uniform circular motion means that the speed $v_1=||{\\bf v}_1||$ at $A$ and the speed $v_2=||{\\bf v}_2||$ at $B$ are equal. We will call the speed $v$, so both $v_1=v$ and $v_2=v$, but the directions are *not* the same. \n",

    "The rest of the diagram is supposed to show how the velocity vector changed. Define the change in vector v=v2-v1. To visualize it, we have moved v2 to the point on the circle midway between $A$ and $B$. Similarly we have moved ${\\bf v}_1$, but we have also flipped it over to represent $-{\\bf v}_1$. Vectors are added “tip to tail”, so the sum of the two vectors gives the size and direction of the vector $\\Delta{\\bf v}={\\bf v}_2-{\\bf v}_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now recall that the acceleration vector [(3)](#a) is in the direction of v, which is pointing directly toward the center of the circle. Such a direction is called **centripetal**, so the acceleration is centripetal\n",

    "Consider the diagram at above in which we study the change in position of a particle in uniform circular motion from the point $A$ to $B$. As before, the velocity changes from ${\\bf v}_1$ to ${\\bf v}_2$. On the right, we have constructed a triangle from these two vectors together with their difference $\\Delta {\\bf v}$. The key is to note that this triangle is similar to the triangle $ABC$. This implies that the ratio $\\frac{\\delta v}{v_1}$ is equal to the ratio of the lengths of $AB$ to $CA$. Now the size of ${\\bf v}_1$ is $v$, and the length of $CA$ is the radius $r$ of the circle, so if we can figure out what the length is of $AB$, then we can calculate the size of the centripetal acceleration $a_c=\\frac {\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$. This is not difficult to calculate if we note that the length of $AB$ is very nearly the arclength that the particle travels in going from the point $A$ on the circle to the point $B$ on the circle. This length is given by the speed the particle is traveling, namely $v$, times the time $\\Delta t$ that it takes to do so. Thus the ratio of the lengths of  $AB$ and $CA$ is very nearly $\\frac {v\\Delta t}r$, and the approximation gets better as we take ever smaller time intervals $\\Delta t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude that by similarity of the velocity triangle and the spatial triangle, $\\frac{\\Delta v}v\\approx \\frac{v\\Delta t}r$. Rearranging gives the acceleration $a_c=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}\\approx \\frac{v^2}r$ with the approximation getting ever better as $\\Delta t\\to 0$. This demonstrates that the exact formula for the centripetal acceleration is given by equation ([10](#eq:a_c)). \n",
