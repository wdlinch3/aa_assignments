    "This is [begging the question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question). First Newton had to figure out what the force of gravity was proportional to. He relized from Newton II that it should be proportional to mass (in $F=ma$, $F$ is proportional to both $m$ and $a$) and this should be true for each mass. Whence it should be proportional to their product. \n",
    "\n",
    "He also knew that it fell off with distance, but lots of things do that. Is it proportional to $1/r$? $1/\\sqrt{r}$? $1/r^2$? $e^{-r}$?? He realized it was quadratic when he calculated the acceleration needed to keep the Moon in its orbit, so then he knew $F\\propto \\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$. Only then could he conclude that there is a constant $G$ such that $F=G\\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$, and only *then* could he conclude anything about the length-dependence. \n",

When the particle is at the point labeled $A$, it has velocity ${\\bf v}_1$ and when it is at the point labeled $B$ it has velocity ${\\bf v}_2$. Uniform circular motion means that the speed $v_1=||{\\bf v}_1||$ at $A$ and the speed $v_2=||{\\bf v}_2||$ at $B$ are equal. We will call the speed $v$, so both $v_1=v$ and $v_2=v$, but the directions are *not* the same. \n",

Vectors are added “tip to tail”, so the sum of the two vectors gives the size and direction of the vector $\\Delta{\\bf v}={\\bf v}_2-{\\bf v}_1$.\n",

    "Consider the diagram at above in which we study the change in position of a particle in uniform circular motion from the point $A$ to $B$. As before, the velocity changes from ${\\bf v}_1$ to ${\\bf v}_2$. On the right, we have constructed a triangle from these two vectors together with their difference $\\Delta {\\bf v}$. The key is to note that this triangle is similar to the triangle $ABC$. This implies that the ratio $\\frac{\\delta v}{v_1}$ is equal to the ratio of the lengths of $AB$ to $CA$. Now the size of ${\\bf v}_1$ is $v$, and the length of $CA$ is the radius $r$ of the circle, so if we can figure out what the length is of $AB$, then we can calculate the size of the centripetal acceleration $a_c=\\frac {\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$. This is not difficult to calculate if we note that the length of $AB$ is very nearly the arclength that the particle travels in going from the point $A$ on the circle to the point $B$ on the circle. This length is given by the speed the particle is traveling, namely $v$, times the time $\\Delta t$ that it takes to do so. Thus the ratio of the lengths of  $AB$ and $CA$ is very nearly $\\frac {v\\Delta t}r$, and the approximation gets better as we take ever smaller time intervals $\\Delta t$. \n",

    "We conclude that by similarity of the velocity triangle and the spatial triangle, $\\frac{\\Delta v}v\\approx \\frac{v\\Delta t}r$. Rearranging gives the acceleration $a_c=\\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}\\approx \\frac{v^2}r$ with the approximation getting ever better as $\\Delta t\\to 0$. This demonstrates that the exact formula for the centripetal acceleration is given by equation ([10](#eq:a_c)). \n",

    "<a id=\"fn:1\">[^1]</a>:  If you are paying very close attention, you may object that we only know that momentum is *proportional* to the product of the mass and the velocity. However, since we are introducing the concept of momentum here, the constant of proportionality can be chosen to be 1\\. (If it weren’t, say it were 5, you can just redefine all momenta by that factor of 5.)"
