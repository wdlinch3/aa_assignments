Similarly, the same permutation applied to the third term $((gf)h)\\to ((hg)f)$ looks like the same order as the last term $-(h(gf))$. We notice that if associativity holds, then these terms all cancel. The pattern continues and it is not hard to verify that all terms cancel pairwise *provided the multiplication is associative*. "
