    "[^1]: Actually, this analysis does not hold up under closer inspection. The reason is that in this case there actually *is* another dimensionless parameter, namely the angle from which you released the bob to start the pendulum. Since radians are not dimensionful: $\\pi$ radians is the ratio of the circumference $C$ of a disk to its diameter $D$. Both have the dimensions of length, so $\\left[ \\frac CD \\right]=1$. Because of this, the actual period of a pendulum is $P=f(\\theta) \\sqrt{\\frak \\ell g}$ for a very complicated function $f(\\theta)$. (See [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum#Period_of_oscillation) for more.)\n",
